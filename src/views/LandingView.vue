/**
 * The one page a stranger can reach.
 *
 * A port of the Cansee landing page (ftb-ui, src/pages/LandingPage.vue): the
 * same editorial cream-and-ink system — Instrument Serif for display, Inter for
 * everything else, hierarchy from serif against sans rather than from bold —
 * and the same floating nav pill, split hero, alternating feature rows, sticky
 * FAQ aside and ink footer, with a row of blog cards before the close. What
 * changed on the way over:
 *
 *   - The words are ghostclick's, and every claim is one the product backs up
 *     on the next screen. A landing page that oversells a tool is one the first
 *     real run contradicts.
 *   - The fonts are bundled from @fontsource rather than fetched from Google.
 *     The runner serves this app under `default-src 'self'`, which refuses the
 *     stylesheet and the font files from any other origin.
 *   - The watercolour videos are LandingWell, a CSS gradient — the same CSP,
 *     and the clips are tens of megabytes.
 *   - Behind the hero is a painting: LandingCanvas, a photograph of a canvas
 *     under a wash of cream that thins on the way down, dissolving into the
 *     page before the first section of copy.
 *   - Every call to action is sign in — or, for an account that is already
 *     signed in, the app and a way out.
 *
 * Two states, then. A stranger sees sign in everywhere; an account sees Open
 * the app and Log out, and logging out leaves them here as a stranger. With
 * no control plane there is nothing to sign in to or out of, so the guard
 * sends everyone to the suites (router.js) and this page never mounts.

   ghostclick landing — Cansee's editorial cream-and-ink system

   Two faces for words, and only two:
     · Instrument Serif 400 for display. Never bold. Line-height 1.1.
     · Inter 500 at 16/22.4 for everything else.
   Mono appears only inside the product pictures, because the product uses it.

   Hierarchy comes from serif-vs-sans and from size jumps in the serif, never
   from bolding the sans. The only colour is ghostclick's own: the magenta of
   the mark and the cursor, and the red a failure carries in the product.
