/**
 * Mount only once the first navigation has resolved.
 *
 * Without this, Vue paints immediately and the router has not matched anything
 * yet, so `route.name` is undefined for the first few hundred milliseconds —
 * the two round trips the guard spends in session.boot(), plus the lazy chunk
 * for whichever view wins. App.vue decides whether to draw the application
 * shell from that name, and "not one of the bare pages" was true of undefined,
 * so arriving at /app/login painted the whole signed-in dashboard — sidebar,
 * workspace, empty suite list — and then replaced it with the sign-in form.
 * A stranger's first frame was somebody's console.
 *
 * The cost is honest: a blank page for exactly as long as the flash used to
 * last. Blank is the truth at that moment. The dashboard was not.
 *
 * `.then()` rather than a top-level await, which needs a build target that
 * supports it and would be a strange thing to make the whole bundle depend on.
 *
 * Two ways this could strand a blank page, and both mount anyway rather than
 * leave one:
 *
 *   The navigation THROWS. isReady() rejects, and an app that never mounted is
 *   a white page with no way back — strictly worse than the flash this fixes.
 *
 *   The navigation never finishes. The guard awaits session.boot(), which is
 *   two fetches at the control plane, and fetch has no timeout of its own: a
 *   host that accepts the connection and then says nothing hangs them for as
 *   long as the socket is open. Rejection never comes, so a catch is no help;
 *   only a clock is. Before this file waited for anything that case showed a
 *   dashboard forever, which was wrong but at least visible. Blank forever
 *   would be a worse trade, so there is a deadline.
 *
 * Mounting early is safe precisely because App.vue refuses to draw the shell
 * for a route that has not matched. The two changes hold each other up: this
 * one removes the flash, that one makes the flash unrepresentable.
