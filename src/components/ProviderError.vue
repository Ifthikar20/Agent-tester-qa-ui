/**
 * What a Google sign-in that did not work looks like (docs/AUTH.md §6.2).
 *
 * The control plane answers every refusal with the same word in the
 * callback — `?error=refused` — and keeps the real reason for its audit
 * log, because the reason is a fact about somebody's account: the address
 * exists, or is not verified, or already has another Google identity, or
 * was not invited [credentials-3]. So this shows one sentence, whatever
 * happened, and the way back. A cancel is the person's own doing and is
 * said plainly; it says nothing about any account.
 *
 * `process` is the one the browser itself asked for, so it is safe to
 * word the sentence for it: a refused connect is not a refused sign-in.
