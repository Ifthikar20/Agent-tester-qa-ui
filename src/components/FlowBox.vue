/**
 * A flow script. Monospace, editable when the parent wants it, and never
 * rendered as a diagram here — the diagram is mermaid's job and it lives in the
 * console, where there is room for it.
 *
 * Read-only, it is FlowRead: the steps in order, coloured by what they do, with
 * the raw text one switch away, and a Read switch shows the same while editing.
 *
 * Editable, it is coloured as you type — and still a plain textarea, so the
 * caret, selection, undo and paste are the browser's own. The colour is a copy
 * of the text drawn in a <pre> underneath, with the textarea's own glyphs made
 * transparent. Nothing about typing is re-implemented, so nothing about typing
 * can lag or drop a key. It was a bare textarea until now for fear of exactly
 * that, and a black-and-white script beside a coloured recording read as two
 * different languages.
