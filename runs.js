/**
 * Run history.
 *
 * A dashboard of invented numbers is worse than no dashboard, so every finished
 * run is appended here and the page reads from it. Machine-local and gitignored,
 * like the rest of `.ghostclick/` — this is a record of what happened on your
 * machine, not project data.
 *
 * One history PER ORGANISATION, in `.ghostclick/<org>/runs.json` (docs/AUTH.md
 * §10). It is also where two of the plan's numbers are counted from: how many
 * runs the organisation has made today (`runs.per_day`) and how far back its
 * history is kept (`history.retention_days`). Both are read from THIS file,
 * never from anything the client sent — a limit counted from a number the UI
 * reports would be a limit the UI sets.
