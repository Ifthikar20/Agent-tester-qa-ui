/**
 * Defects: numbered, filed by the runner, triaged by people.
 *
 * Run history answers "what happened". This answers "what is broken", and
 * gives each answer a number a person can say out loud and paste into a
 * ticket: DEF-2609-007 is the seventh distinct failure first seen in
 * September 2026.
 *
 * Nobody files a defect. Every run is folded in here: a failure joins the
 * defect it has been before or is filed as a new one, a pass closes every
 * open defect that took its case down, and a failure that comes back after
 * that reopens its defect under the same number. Filing, closing and
 * reopening are the application's, and each lands in the defect's activity
 * as ghostclick's.
 *
 * People triage. An owner or admin may assign a defect, overrule the severity
 * the runner worked out, or park it as a known issue or won't-fix — the only
 * three things a person writes, each recorded with who wrote it. A parked
 * defect that starts passing is closed like any other: the decision was about
 * a failure that has stopped happening, so if it comes back it comes back
 * reopened, for someone to look at again, rather than hidden under last
 * month's "won't fix".
 *
 * A MONITOR'S INCIDENT IS A DEFECT TOO. A monitored element (or the whole
 * page) that breaks its rule and is confirmed (monitor.js) is filed here as
 * it opens, under the same numbers as a failed run, and closed as it
 * resolves — on its own, by a person accepting the new state, or by Claude
 * judging the change fine. Its identity is the monitor and the checks that
 * failed: the same rule breaking the same way again reopens the same number.
 * It has no cases, so a passing run never closes it, and its evidence is the
 * incident's: the failed checks, the verdict's severity, the before and after
 * clips. The Defects page is then one page for what is broken, whichever way
 * the runner found out.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES TWO FAILURES ONE DEFECT. A run records only its first failure,
 * because a run stops there, so a defect is that sentence, about the step that
 * failed, on the site it happened on. Grouping by what failed rather than by
 * the case is the point: one broken selector takes down four cases, and four
 * rows saying the same thing is a list, not a diagnosis. The step is part of
 * it because a sentence is not always about anything — Playwright says
 * "locator.waitFor: Timeout 8000ms exceeded." of every wait that runs out, and
 * a missing receipt and a missing price are two defects. The site is part of
 * it because the same failure on two sites is two problems. How long something
 * waited is not, because "did not turn up in the 10.5s this waited" and
 * "…10.4s…" are the same wait running out.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY. Defects used to be recomputed from run history on every
 * read, which was honest and could not number anything: history is capped and
 * pruned, so a number derived from it would move as old runs fell off the end.
 * This keeps what a number needs — above all each month's counter, so a
 * number is never handed out twice — and is brought up to date from history
 * after every run and before every read, so it cannot drift from what ran.
 *
 * One registry per organisation, `.ghostclick/<org>/defects.json`, beside the
 * history it is read out of. Machine-local and gitignored, like the rest.
