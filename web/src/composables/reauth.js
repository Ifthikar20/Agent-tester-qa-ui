/**
 * A sensitive change, and the proof the control plane may ask for first.
 *
 * Every view that changes something the control plane guards — the
 * password, the address, an authenticator, the recovery codes, a Google
 * identity, an allowed origin on the runner — has the same shape: try it;
 * if the answer is "prove it is you first", show the reauthentication
 * sheet; when the sheet says done, try the same thing again. This is that
 * shape once, so no view carries its own copy of the retry.
 *
 *   const guard = useGuarded();
 *   guard.run(() => session.changeEmail(email))   // 'ok' | 'reauthenticate' | 'error' | ...
 *   <ReauthSheet v-if="guard.flow.value" :flow="guard.flow.value" @done="guard.proved()" @cancel="guard.cancel()" />
 *
 * `run` answers 'reauthenticate' when the sheet is up, whatever kind of
 * proof was asked for; the store's outcome is passed through otherwise.
 *
 * `switched` is for the sheet: the flow it opened on can turn out to be the
 * wrong one. The runner's step-up refusal names no proof, so the view guesses
 * from the session's cached `mfa.enrolled` — and when that is stale (enrolled
 * in another tab, or /auth/me not refreshed since) the sheet opens on the
 * password form, the control plane answers 401 mfa_reauthenticate, and the
 * person is told a correct password was not accepted with no way forward.
 * A different proof being wanted is not a failure; it is a different sheet.
