/**
 * The frontend, as its own project.
 *
 * `web/` is a self-contained Vite app. Nothing under it reads a file outside
 * it, and nothing it produces is written outside it — those two properties are
 * what make "lift this directory into its own repository" a `git mv` rather
 * than a refactor, and `npm run check:boundary` fails the moment either stops
 * being true.
 *
 * The two things it needs from the backend are both configuration:
 *
 *   GC_API         where `npm run dev` proxies /api and /ws (build-time, dev only)
 *   VITE_API_URL   where the BUILT app sends them (runtime; see src/config.js)
 *
 * Same-origin — the app served by the backend it talks to — is the default and
 * needs neither. See docs/BOUNDARY.md.
